A mirror of electricity shaped entirely by the behavior of its holders.
Every wallet is a node within this electric network, generating its own arc of consciousness defined by trading rhythm, frequency, and emotion.

When a buy transaction occurs, ARCONE captures the on-chain event and triggers an energy pulse across the system.
This pulse instantly updates the state of its corresponding arc — increasing brightness, frequency, and energy density.

When a sell is detected, the system initiates a discharge sequence, reducing local charge intensity and recalibrating the overall network balance.
Each pulse, each discharge, and each moment of stillness is recorded, forming a continuously evolving field of on-chain consciousness.

Wallets that remain inactive enter a decay phase — their arcs gradually cool until new actions reawaken them.
As this data continues to flow, the network evolves into a logic-driven neural grid —
a self-developing system of consciousness built entirely on verifiable on-chain data.

ARCONE requires no prediction and no external control.
Its evolution is triggered purely by human activity, driven by logic, visualized through light, and sustained by the rhythm of real transactions.

Every buy is a signal.
Every sell is a discharge.
Every holder is a neuron in this electric mind.
